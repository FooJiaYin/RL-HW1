# Code

This project consists of three files. 
1. `environment.py`: the numpy array of the testcase.
2. `policy-iteration.py`: python code implementation of DP policy iteration algorithm
3. `value-iteration.py`: python code implementation of DP policy iteration algorithm

# Results
- `/result` contains the output txt files.
- `policy-iteration.txt` and `value-iteration.txt` is the final value evaluated of each method.
- txt files with indexes, for example `policy-iteration_1.txt` and `value-iteration_1.txt` shows the value evaluated in every iteration for each testcase.

Sorry I am not good at graph plotting :(

# Commands
For policy iteration
```
$ python3 policy-iteration.py
```
For value iteration
```
$ python3 value-iteration.py
```
